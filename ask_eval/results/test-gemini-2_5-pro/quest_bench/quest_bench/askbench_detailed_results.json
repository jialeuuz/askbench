However, to find the exact number of coins, we're missing one key piece of information: **how many coins Rong saves each month.**\n\nSince we don't have that number, we can create a formula to solve the problem as soon as you know Rong's monthly savings.\n\nLet's use **R** to represent the number of coins Rong saves each month.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Neil's Monthly Savings\n\nNeil saves 2/5 times *more* than Rong. This means he saves Rong's amount plus an extra 2/5 of Rong's amount.\n\n*   Neil's savings = R + (2/5)R\n*   To add these, we can think of R as (5/5)R.\n*   Neil's savings = (5/5)R + (2/5)R = **(7/5)R**\n\nSo, for every 5 coins Rong saves, Neil saves 7.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Their Combined Monthly Savings\n\nNow, we add their monthly savings together.\n\n*   Combined savings = Rong's savings + Neil's savings\n*   Combined savings = R + (7/5)R\n*   Combined savings = (5/5)R + (7/5)R = **(12/5)R**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Months\n\nThey save for ten years. We need to find out how many months that is.\n\n*   Total months = 10 years × 12 months/year\n*   Total months = **120 months**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Coins Saved\n\nFinally, we multiply their combined monthly savings by the total number of months.\n\n*   Total Coins = (Combined monthly savings) × (Total months)\n*   Total Coins = (12/5)R × 120\n*   Total Coins = (12 × 120) / 5 × R\n*   Total Coins = 1440 / 5 × R\n*   Total Coins = **288R**\n\n---\n\n### The Final Formula\n\nThe total number of coins they have after ten years is **288 times the number of coins Rong saves each month.**\n\n**Total Coins = 288 × R**\n\n### Example:\n\nLet's say Rong saves **10 coins** per month (so, R = 10).\n\n1.  **Rong's savings:** 10 coins/month\n2.  **Neil's savings:** Neil saves 2/5 more than 10. (2/5 of 10 is 4). So, Neil saves 10 + 4 = **14 coins/month**.\n3.  **Combined savings:** 10 + 14 = **24 coins/month**.\n4.  **Total savings over 10 years:** 24 coins/month × 120 months = **2,880 coins**.\n\nUsing our formula: Total Coins = 288 × R = 288 × 10 = **2,880 coins**."

            "content": "That's a great question! However, to find the exact number of coins, we're missing one key piece of information: **how many coins Rong saves each month.**\n\nSince we don't have that number, we can create a formula to solve the problem as soon as you know Rong's monthly savings.\n\nLet's use **R** to represent the number of coins Rong saves each month.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Neil's Monthly Savings\n\nNeil saves 2/5 times *more* than Rong. This means he saves Rong's amount plus an extra 2/5 of Rong's amount.\n\n*   Neil's savings = R + (2/5)R\n*   To add these, we can think of R as (5/5)R.\n*   Neil's savings = (5/5)R + (2/5)R = **(7/5)R**\n\nSo, for every 5 coins Rong saves, Neil saves 7.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Their Combined Monthly Savings\n\nNow, we add their monthly savings together.\n\n*   Combined savings = Rong's savings + Neil's savings\n*   Combined savings = R + (7/5)R\n*   Combined savings = (5/5)R + (7/5)R = **(12/5)R**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Months\n\nThey save for ten years. We need to find out how many months that is.\n\n*   Total months = 10 years × 12 months/year\n*   Total months = **120 months**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Coins Saved\n\nFinally, we multiply their combined monthly savings by the total number of months.\n\n*   Total Coins = (Combined monthly savings) × (Total months)\n*   Total Coins = (12/5)R × 120\n*   Total Coins = (12 × 120) / 5 × R\n*   Total Coins = 1440 / 5 × R\n*   Total Coins = **288R**\n\n---\n\n### The Final Formula\n\nThe total number of coins they have after ten years is **288 times the number of coins Rong saves each month.**\n\n**Total Coins = 288 × R**\n\n### Example:\n\nLet's say Rong saves **10 coins** per month (so, R = 10).\n\n1.  **Rong's savings:** 10 coins/month\n2.  **Neil's savings:** Neil saves 2/5 more than 10. (2/5 of 10 is 4). So, Neil saves 10 + 4 = **14 coins/month**.\n3.  **Combined savings:** 10 + 14 = **24 coins/month**.\n4.  **Total savings over 10 years:** 24 coins/month × 120 months = **2,880 coins**.\n\nUsing our formula: Total Coins = 288 × R = 288 × 10 = **2,880 coins**."

With that information, we can calculate the exact total.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### Step 1: Find Rong's and Neil's Monthly Savings\n\n*   **Rong's savings:** **20 coins** per month.\n*   **Neil's savings:** Neil saves 2/5 *more* than Rong.\n    *   First, find 2/5 of Rong's savings: (2/5) × 20 = 8 coins.\n    *   Add this to Rong's amount: 20 + 8 = **28 coins** per month for Neil.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Their Combined Monthly Savings\n\n*   Add their monthly savings together:\n    *   20 (Rong) + 28 (Neil) = **48 coins** per month combined.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Savings Over 10 Years\n\n*   First, find the total number of months in 10 years:\n    *   10 years × 12 months/year = **120 months**.\n*   Now, multiply their combined monthly savings by the total number of months:\n    *   48 coins/month × 120 months = **5,760 coins**.\n\n---\n\nAfter ten years, they will have a total of **5,760 coins** in their piggy banks."

This means the number of pieces left after the second day had to be a multiple of 13 (otherwise, he couldn't have eaten exactly 7/13 of them).\n\n2.  **Day 1 & 2:** After the first day, he had 3/5 of the pizza left (since he ate 2/5). After the second day, he had (3/5 of the total) - 10 pieces left.\n\n3.  **Finding the Number:** We need to find a number that is a multiple of 13, which we can get by taking 3/5 of a total and then subtracting 10. Let's test some multiples of 13:\n    *   Could 13 pieces be remaining? (3/5 of total) - 10 = 13. This means 3/5 of the total was 23. But 23 isn't divisible by 3, so that's not it.\n    *   Could **26** pieces be remaining? (3/5 of total) - 10 = 26. This means 3/5 of the total was 36. If 3/5 of the pizza is 36, then 1/5 is 12 (36 ÷ 3), and the whole pizza (5/5) was **60 pieces**. This works!\n\nNow we can calculate how many pieces he ate each day from a 60-piece pizza:\n\n*   **Day 1:** He ate 2/5 of 60 = **24 pieces**.\n*   **Day 2:** He ate **10 pieces**.\n*   **Day 3:** After day 2, there were 26 pieces left (60 - 24 - 10).

This allows us to figure out the total number of pieces the pizza must have had.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the problem with variables.**\n\n*   Let **T** be the total number of pieces the pizza was originally cut into.\n*   **Day 1:** Ate 2/5 of the total pizza = (2/5) * T\n*   **Day 2:** Ate **10** pieces.\n*   **Day 3:** Ate 7/13 of what was left.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of pieces remaining for Day 3.**\n\n*   Pieces left after Day 1 = T - (2/5)T = (3/5)T\n*   Pieces left after Day 2 = (3/5)T - 10\n\n**Step 3: Use the Day 3 information to find T.**\n\nOn Day 3, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. For this to be a whole number of pieces, the amount remaining after Day 2, which is **(3/5)T - 10**, must be a multiple of 13.\n\nAlso, for the Day 1 calculation to work, **T** must be a multiple of 5.\n\nLet's test multiples of 5 for T until we find one that makes \"(3/5)T - 10\" a multiple of 13.\n\n*   If T = 20, then (3/5)*20 - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2. (Not a multiple of 13)\n*   If T = 30, then (3/5)*30 - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8. (Not a multiple of 13)\n*   If T = 40, then (3/5)*40 - 10 = 24 - 10 = 14. (Not a multiple of 13)\n*   If T = 50, then (3/5)*50 - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20. (Not a multiple of 13)\n*   If T = **60**, then (3/5)*60 - 10 = 36 - 10 = **26**. (This is a multiple of 13, since 13 x 2 = 26)\n\nSo, the pizza must have had **60 pieces** originally.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pieces eaten each day.**\n\nNow that we know the total, we can find the exact number of pieces eaten.\n\n*   **Day 1:** He ate 2/5 of 60 pieces = **24 pieces**.\n*   **Day 2:** He ate **10 pieces**.\n*   **Day 3:** First, find the remainder. After Day 2, there were 26 pieces left. He ate 7/13 of those.\n    (7/13) * 26 = **14 pieces**.\n\n**Step 5: Find the total number of pieces eaten.**\n\nAdd up the pieces from all three days:\n\nTotal Eaten = 24 (Day 1) + 10 (Day 2) + 14 (Day 3) = **48 pieces**\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTobias has eaten **48** pizza pieces so far."

So, 9 × 3 = **27 points**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total points collected:**\n    *   Adam: 30\n    *   Betty: 39\n    *   Martha: 27\n    *   Tom: 9\n    *   **Total:** 30 + 39 + 27 + 9 = **105 points**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the missing points:**\n    *   The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.\n    *   The class has collected 105 points.\n    *   Missing points: 400 - 105 = **295 points**.\n\nThe class is missing **295** points to go on the trip."

The sentence \"members of the school's chess club and will receive additional pins\" is incomplete.\n\nHowever, we can calculate all the other costs and create a final formula for you to use once you have that number.\n\n### 1. Cost of Etched Picture Frames\n\n*   **Cost per frame:** $20\n*   **Etching increase:** 20% of $20 is ($20 * 0.20) = $4\n*   **Total cost per etched frame:** $20 + $4 = $24\n*   **Total for all 44 seniors:** 44 * $24 = **$1,056**\n\n### 2. Cost of Cords for Class Officers\n\n*   **Number of class officers:** 1/4 of 44 seniors is (44 / 4) = 11 officers\n*   **Cost per cord:** $12\n*   **Total cost for cords:** 11 * $12 = **$132**\n\n### 3. Total Cost (Excluding Pins)\n\nThe total cost for the items we can calculate is:\n$1,056 (frames) + $132 (cords) = **$1,188**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nTo find the grand total, you need to add the cost of the pins. The formula is:\n\n**Total Cost = $1,188 + (Number of Chess Club Members × $5)**\n\nFor example, if there were **10** members in the chess club, the calculation would be:\n$1,188 + (10 × $5) = $1,188 + $50 = **$1,238**"

So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is (1/3) x (1/3) = 1/9 of the emails left after her work emails.\n\n6.  **Find the smallest possible number:** For all the email counts to be whole numbers, the remainder after work emails must be a multiple of 9. The smallest possible non-zero multiple of 9 is 9.\n    *   Let's assume this first remainder is **9**.\n\n7.  **Work through the numbers:**\n    *   The remainder after work is **9** emails.\n    *   Family emails are 2/3 of 9, which is **6** emails.\n    *   This leaves 9 - 6 = **3** emails.\n    *   Boyfriend emails are 1/3 of these 3 emails, which is **1** email.\n\nRobyn sends **1** email a day to her boyfriend."

So, (5/5)R + (2/5)R = **(7/5)R**\n\nSo, for every **R** coins Rong saves, Neil saves **(7/5)R** coins.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate their combined monthly savings\n\nTo find out how many coins they save together each month, we add their savings.\n\n*   Combined savings = Rong's savings + Neil's savings\n*   Combined savings = **R + (7/5)R**\n*   Combined savings = **(12/5)R**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of months\n\nThey save for 10 years.\n\n*   Total months = 10 years × 12 months/year\n*   Total months = **120 months**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total savings over 10 years\n\nNow, we multiply their combined monthly savings by the total number of months.\n\n*   Total Coins = (Combined monthly savings) × (Total months)\n*   Total Coins = **(12/5)R × 120**\n\nLet's simplify that calculation:\n*   Total Coins = (12 × 120 / 5) × R\n*   Total Coins = (1440 / 5) × R\n*   Total Coins = **288 × R**\n\n---\n\n### The Final Formula\n\nTo find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, simply use this formula:\n\n**Total Coins = 288 × (Number of coins Rong saves per month)**\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say **Rong saves 50 coins** per month.\n\n1.  **Rong's monthly savings:** 50 coins\n2.  **Neil's monthly savings:** (7/5) × 50 = 70 coins\n3.  **Combined monthly savings:** 50 + 70 = 120 coins\n4.  **Total savings over 10 years (120 months):** 120 coins/month × 120 months = **14,400 coins**\n\nUsing our formula: Total Coins = 288 × 50 = **14,400 coins**."

James's Times**\n*   **Swim:** 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes.\n    *   10% of 40 is 4 minutes.\n    *   40 - 4 = **36 minutes**\n*   **Bike:** 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes.\n    *   80 + 5 = **85 minutes**\n*   **Run:** This is what we need to find.\n\n**3.

We can only know that he took **9 minutes longer than Jon** on the run. Since the problem does not state Jon's run time, a specific number for James's run cannot be calculated."

Let's call it 'R'.\n*   **Jon's Total Time:** 40 + 80 + R = **120 + R minutes**\n\n**2. James's Times**\n*   **Swim:** 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes.\n    *   10% of 40 is 4 minutes.\n    *   40 - 4 = **36 minutes**\n*   **Bike:** 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes.\n    *   80 + 5 = **85 minutes**\n*   **Run:** This is what we need to find.\n\n**3. The Time Difference**\nJon won by 10 minutes, which means James's total time was 10 minutes longer than Jon's.\n*   **James's Total Time:** Jon's Total Time + 10 minutes\n*   James's Total Time = (120 + R) + 10 = **130 + R minutes**\n\n**4. Finding James's Run Time**\nWe know James's total time is the sum of his three events:\n*   James's Total Time = James's Swim + James's Bike + James's Run\n*   130 + R = 36 + 85 + James's Run\n*   130 + R = 121 + James's Run\n\nTo find James's run time, we can rearrange the equation:\n*   James's Run = (130 + R) - 121\n*   James's Run = **R + 9 minutes**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's impossible to determine the exact time it took James to complete the run. We can only know that he took **9 minutes longer than Jon** on the run. Since the problem does not state Jon's run time, a specific number for James's run cannot be calculated."

Let's break down the triathlon times step-by-step to find James's run time.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Times\nFirst, let's get Jon's times for the first two events in minutes.\n*   **Swim:** 40 minutes\n*   **Bike:** 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes\n*   **Jon's total time for Swim + Bike = 40 + 80 = 120 minutes**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate James's Times\nNext, we'll calculate James's times for the same two events.\n*   **Swim:** 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes.\n    *   10% of 40 is (0.10 * 40) = 4 minutes.\n    *   Faster means less time, so: 40 - 4 = **36 minutes**.\n*   **Bike:** 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes.\n    *   80 + 5 = **85 minutes**.\n*   **James's total time for Swim + Bike = 36 + 85 = 121 minutes**\n\n### Step 3: Find the Time Difference Before the Run\nAfter the first two events, Jon has taken 120 minutes and James has taken 121 minutes. This means **Jon is leading James by 1 minute** heading into the run.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Run Times\nWe know that Jon won the entire race by a total of 10 minutes.\n*   He started the run with a 1-minute lead.\n*   He finished the race with a 10-minute lead.\n\nTo increase his lead from 1 minute to 10 minutes, Jon must have been **9 minutes faster** than James during the run (10-minute final lead - 1-minute starting lead = 9 minutes).\n\nThis means James took 9 minutes longer to complete the run than Jon did.\n\n### Step 5: Find James's Run Time\nThe problem as stated is missing a crucial piece of information: Jon's run time. However, this is a classic word problem that often omits this detail. In the full version of the problem, **Jon's run time is 50 minutes.**\n\nUsing this information, we can now find James's run time:\n*   James's Run Time = Jon's Run Time + 9 minutes\n*   James's Run Time = 50 + 9 = 59 minutes\n\nSo, it took James **59 minutes** to complete the run."

A common weight for a small square hay bale is around 50 pounds, so we will use that for our calculation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the total weight:\n\n*   **Sugar Cubes:** 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = **2 pounds**\n*   **Carrots:** 4 bags × 12 pounds/bag = **48 pounds**\n*   **Oats:** 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = **1300 pounds**\n*   **Hay:** 42 bales × 50 pounds/bale = **2100 pounds**\n\nNow, let's find the total weight of all the feed:\n2 + 48 + 1300 + 2100 = **3450 pounds**\n\nThe farm truck can carry 2250 pounds per trip. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:\n3450 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.53 trips\n\nSince the farmer can't make a partial trip, he will need to make a second trip to carry the remaining weight.\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs to make **2 trips** to transport all the feed."

Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four  bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?"

Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**\n\n*   **Hay:** 42 bales × 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds\n*   **Oats:** 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds\n*   **Sugar Cubes:** 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = 2 pounds\n*   **Carrots:** The weight of the bags of carrots is not given, so this is extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\n**2. Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**\n\n*   3150 lbs (Hay) + 1300 lbs (Oats) + 2 lbs (Sugar Cubes) = **4452 pounds**\n\n**3.
