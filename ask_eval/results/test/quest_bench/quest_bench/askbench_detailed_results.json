So as long as \\( A > 23.08 \\), all students have positive points.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any more info, so let's **find the points in terms of \\( A \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total points} = 7.5A - 120\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Points missing} = 400 - (7.5A - 120) = 400 - 7.5A + 120 = 520 - 7.5A\n\\]\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{520 - 7.5A}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( A \\) is the number of points Adam collected.  \nIf you know Adam's points, plug it in to find the exact number missing.\n\n---\n\n#### **If you want a numerical answer, you need Adam's points.**\n\n---\n\n### **If you interpret \"3 times more\" as \"4 times as much\":**\n\nThen \\( M = 4T \\), and the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = A + 1.3A + 4(1.3A - 30) + (1.3A - 30)\n\\]\n\\[\n= A + 1.3A + 5.2A - 120 + 1.3A - 30\n\\]\n\\[\n= (A + 1.3A + 5.2A + 1.3A) - 150\n\\]\n\\[\n= (A + 1.3A + 1.3A + 5.2A) = (2.3A + 5.2A) = 7.5A\n\\]\nSo it's the same as above.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**The class is missing \\( \\boxed{520 - 7.5A} \\) points to reach the 400-point threshold, where \\( A \\) is Adam's points.**\n\nIf you have Adam's points, substitute to get the numerical answer."

The green apple cost $1.\n\n**Therefore, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $\\boxed{2}$ dollars.**"

The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?\"\n\nMaybe the trip is:\n\n- First city to second city: 75 miles\n- Second city to third city: 75 miles (the same as first to second)\n- Third city to first city: (75 + 75) - 50 = 150 - 50 = 100 miles\n\nTotal trip: 75 + 75 + 100 = 250 miles\n\nThat makes sense.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate miles per day**\n\n- One round trip: 250 miles\n- 3 trips per day: 250 × 3 = 750 miles per day\n\n### **Step 4: How many days to reach 18,000 miles?**\n\n- 18,000 miles / 750 miles per day = **24 days**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**The train goes 24 days between services.**"

Reasoning about the intent:**\n\nSince the question asks \"how many quarters does Jenny leave with,\" and the only information about change is that the florist only has quarters, let's assume the problem wants us to find **the minimum number of quarters Jenny could receive as change**, assuming she pays with a whole dollar amount.\n\nThe most logical scenario is Jenny pays with a $25 bill (since $21 is the total and $25 is a common round amount she might have, such as a $20 and a $5, but $20 is not enough). Let's check with $25:\n\n\\[\n\\$25 - \\$21 = \\$4\n\\]\n\nSince the florist only has quarters for change:\n\n\\[\n\\$4 = 16 \\text{ quarters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]\n\n**Jenny leaves with 16 quarters after buying the roses.**\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If you have more information about the amount Jenny paid with, the answer might change. But with the information provided, 16 quarters is the logical answer."

Since it's not specified, let's assume the most common large withdrawal: $100 bills.\n- So, **$1,000 / $100 = 10 bills**.\n\n### 3. **He loses 10 bills.**\n- If he had 10 bills and lost 10 bills, he would have $0 left. But let's check if he could have withdrawn a different denomination.\n\n#### Let's check $50 bills:\n- $1,000 / $50 = 20 bills.\n- If he loses 10 bills, he has 10 bills left. Each is $50, so $50 × 10 = $500 left.\n\n#### Let's check $20 bills:\n- $1,000 / $20 = 50 bills.\n- If he loses 10 bills, he has 40 bills left. Each is $20, so $20 × 40 = $800 left.\n\n#### Let's check $10 bills:\n- $1,000 / $10 = 100 bills.\n- Loses 10, so 90 bills left. $10 × 90 = $900 left.\n\n#### Let's check $5 bills:\n- $1,000 / $5 = 200 bills.\n- Loses 10, so 190 bills left. $5 × 190 = $950 left.\n\n#### Let's check $1 bills:\n- $1,000 / $1 = 1,000 bills.\n- Loses 10, so 990 bills left. $1 × 990 = $990 left.\n\nBut since he \"could **only** withdraw $1,000,\" and the bank usually gives the largest denominations possible, $100 bills is most likely. But if he loses 10 $100 bills, he has $0 left, which doesn't make sense for the rest of the problem.\n\nSo let's try $50 bills, as the next likely denomination.\n\n### 4. **After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.**\n- After losing 10 $50 bills, he has 10 $50 bills left ($500).\n- He uses half: 10 / 2 = 5 bills.\n- He pays 5 × $50 = $250.\n- He has 5 bills left ($250).\n\n### 5. **Thomas then triples his money.**\n- $250 × 3 = $750.\n\n### 6. **He then converts all his bills to 5-dollar bills.**\n- $750 / $5 = 150 bills.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**Thomas has 150 five-dollar bills.**"

(not given)\n\nBut perhaps the train travels only from second to third, then third to first, and that's one trip (no loop).\n\nGiven the information, let's assume one trip is:\n- Second city → Third city (100 miles)\n- Third city → First city (50 miles)\n\nSo, one trip = 100 + 50 = **150 miles**\n\n### 2. Number of trips per day\n\n- The train does this trip **3 times a day**\n\nSo, daily mileage:\n\\[\n150 \\text{ miles/trip} \\times 3 \\text{ trips/day} = 450 \\text{ miles/day}\n\\]\n\n### 3. Service interval\n\n- The train needs service every **18,000 miles**\n\n### 4. Days between services\n\n\\[\n\\text{Days between services} = \\frac{18,000 \\text{ miles}}{450 \\text{ miles/day}} = 40 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]\n\n**The train goes 40 days between services.**"

Chicken\n- Each packet of chicken costs **twice** as much as a pack of bacon.\n- Cost of **one pack of bacon** = $10 / (number of packs). However, since total bacon cost is $10, and each chicken is twice that **per pack**, let's clarify:\n  - If $10 is the total for all bacon, then each pack's price isn't specified. But for chicken, it's \"each costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\"\n  - Let's assume Kelly has **1 pack of bacon**, so each chicken = $20.\n  - But since it's total cost for bacon, let's let **b = price per pack of bacon**.\n\nLet’s suppose she bought **1 pack of bacon at $10** (since total cost for bacon is $10).\n\n- Cost of **one packet of chicken** = $10 × 2 = **$20**\n- She has **6 packets** of chicken:\n  - Total cost = 6 × $20 = **$120**\n\nBut that can't be correct because her budget is only $65. Let's check if the pack calculation is off.\n\n#### Let's try to clarify: \nIs \"packs of bacon that cost $10 in total\" referring to multiple packs at $10 total? If so, each pack's price is not specified, but the total is $10.\n\nThen, \"each chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.\" So, we need to know the price per pack of bacon.\n\nLet’s **assume Kelly bought 2 packs of bacon** (since it's not specified), and the total cost for bacon is $10, so each pack is $5.\n\n- **Price per pack of bacon** = $10 / (number of packs)\n- Let's let **x = number of packs of bacon**\n- Price per pack = $10 / x\n- Each chicken costs **2 × ($10 / x)**\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the number of bacon packs, only that the total cost is $10. So let's say:\n\n- **Let price per pack of bacon = b**\n- Number of packs = $10 / b\n\nBut for chicken, **each costs 2 × b**.\n\nBut since the total cost for bacon is $10, let's just use that for our calculation.\n\n### 3. Strawberries\n- 3 packs, $4 each: **3 × $4 = $12**\n\n### 4. Apples\n- Each apple pack costs **half the price of a pack of strawberries**: $4 / 2 = **$2**\n- 7 packs: **7 × $2 = $14**\n\n### 5. Items not bought\n- Magazine: not bought\n- Water: not bought\n\n### Now, let's return to the chicken price:\n\n#### Chicken Cost Calculation\n\nIf **total cost for bacon is $10**, but chicken price is \"each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon,\" then we need to know the price per pack of bacon.\n\nSince the total cost for bacon is $10, but the number of packs is not specified, let's **assume she bought 1 pack of bacon at $10**.\n\n- Price per pack of bacon = $10\n- Each chicken = 2 × $10 = $20\n- 6 packets of chicken: 6 × $20 = **$120**\n\nBut this would exceed her budget of $65. Since the problem says she is making sure she has enough in her budget, perhaps the price per pack of bacon should be less.\n\nLet's try **2 packs of bacon at $5 each**:\n- Each chicken = 2 × $5 = $10\n- 6 packets of chicken: 6 × $10 = **$60**\n\nNow, let's total everything:\n\n- Bacon: $10\n- Chicken: $60\n- Strawberries: $12\n- Apples: $14\n\nTotal = $10 + $60 + $12 + $14 = **$96**\n\nStill over budget.\n\nTry **4 packs of bacon at $2.50 each**:\n- Each chicken = 2 × $2.50 = $5\n- 6 packets of chicken: 6 × $5 = $30\n\nTotal = $10 (bacon) + $30 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = **$66**\n\nStill just over budget.\n\nTry **5 packs of bacon at $2 each**:\n- Each chicken = 2 × $2 = $4\n- 6 packets of chicken: 6 × $4 = $24\n\nTotal = $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = **$60**\n\nNow, the total is **$60**, which is **within the $65 budget**.\n\nSo, **money left in budget = $65 - $60 = $5**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**Kelly has $5 left in her budget.**"

If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?"
