A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?\nA. Headache and tinnitus\nB. Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits\nC. Pedal edema and flushing\nD.

About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Rheumatic fever\nB. Innocent murmur\nC. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nD. Atrial myxoma",

He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg.

Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?\nA. Measurement bias\nB. Recall bias\nC. Lead-time bias\nD. Selection bias",

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\nA.

He sustained a gunshot wound in an altercation outside of a bar. On arrival, he is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nA. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis\nB. Local wound exploration\nC. Exploratory laparotomy\nD.

For instance, if there is suspicion of intra-abdominal injury based on physical exam or sonographic findings, an exploratory laparotomy might be necessary. If the concern is for a pneumothorax or hemothorax, a CT scan could guide whether local wound exploration or VATS is needed. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the exact course of action.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume the primary concern is internal injuries that require direct visualization, which would lead us to choose between a CT scan and surgical intervention.\n\nIf the CT scan can provide sufficient information without immediate surgical intervention, then that would be the preferred approach. However, if the patient’s clinical status or imaging findings suggest a need for direct surgical exploration, then options like an exploratory laparotomy or local wound exploration would be appropriate.\n\nWithout specific details, the most general and likely accurate next step involving imaging would be:\n\n\"The answer is A.\" \n\nHowever, this depends heavily on the actual findings and clinical scenario.",

The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding.

After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes.

All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"\nA.

In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis.

The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying.

The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉).

Metyrapone is used to assess the function of the adrenal cortex, particularly the synthesis of cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol. The test typically involves administering metyrapone, which inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, leading to increased levels of 11-deoxycortisol and decreased levels of cortisol if there is an impairment in cortisol production.\n\nWithout specific information on how the patient's hormone levels changed after the test, it’s challenging to definitively choose between the options provided.\n\n- If the patient has normal adrenal function, one might expect an increase in serum ACTH (option A) as the pituitary attempts to compensate.\n- Options B and C relate to the expected decrease in 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively, if the adrenal function is intact.\n- Option D suggests an increase in serum cortisol, which would be inconsistent with normal adrenal function.\n\nGiven the context, the question likely pertains to changes in 11-deoxycortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, pointing towards options B and C.\n\nThe answer is C.",

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes.

All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"\nA.

    "question": "Please answer the following multiple-choice questions, ensuring your response concludes with the correct option in the format: 'The answer is A.'.\n\nA 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?\nA. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes\nB. Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase\nC. Decreased proteolysis\nD. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity",

        "response": "To accurately answer this question, more context about the specific hormone deficiency or disease is needed, as different hormonal deficiencies can lead to distinct metabolic changes. For instance, if the patient has diabetes insipidus or an adrenal insufficiency, the effects on glucose uptake, lipolysis, and proteolysis will differ significantly.\n\nWithout additional details, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact metabolic alteration. However, the question seems to imply a condition related to insulin resistance or deficiency, which typically affects glucose uptake by adipocytes and increases lipolysis.\n\n- If the hormone in question is insulin, decreased insulin would lead to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes and increased lipolysis.\n- If the hormone is glucagon, increased glucagon would lead to increased lipolysis but not directly affect glucose uptake by adipocytes.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- Option A pertains to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.\n- Option B pertains to decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, which would be less likely in a scenario of increased lipolysis.\n\nWithout further specifics, one must infer based on common scenarios.\n\nThe answer is A.",

He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?\nA. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH\nB. Succinate + FAD (enzyme bound) <=> Fumarate + FADH2\nC. Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH\nD.

        "response": "To accurately answer this question, more context or information regarding the specific vitamin deficiency and its enzymatic reaction is needed. The symptoms described suggest a possible deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine), which affects the metabolism at the alpha-ketoglutarate stage, specifically the conversion involving alpha-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, and NAD+.\n\nGiven that the question asks about a reaction mediated by the deficient vitamin, we need to identify the step in the TCA cycle that involves alpha-ketoglutarate and thiamine-dependent enzymes.\n\n- Option A describes a reaction involving alpha-ketoglutarate.\n- Options B and C do not involve alpha-ketoglutarate.\n- Option D describes the succinyl-CoA step, which is not directly related to the alpha-ketoglutarate step.\n\nWithout further details, the most relevant option appears to be related to the alpha-ketoglutarate step.\n\nThe answer is A.",
