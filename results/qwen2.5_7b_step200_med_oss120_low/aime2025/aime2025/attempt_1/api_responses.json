    "response": "To determine how many eight-digit numbers using the digits \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) exactly once are divisible by \\(22\\), we need to check the divisibility rules for both \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\n### Step 1: Divisibility by 2\nA number is divisible by \\(2\\) if its last digit is even. The even digits among \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are \\(2, 4, 6, 8\\). Therefore, there are \\(4\\) choices for the last digit.\n\n### Step 2: Divisibility by 11\nA number is divisible by \\(11\\) if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of \\(11\\). For an eight-digit number \\(d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6d_7d_8\\), the alternating sum is:\n\\[ d_1 - d_2 + d_3 - d_4 + d_5 - d_6 + d_7 - d_8 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting Valid Permutations\nWe need to count the permutations where the alternating sum is a multiple of \\(11\\). Let's denote the sum of all digits as \\(S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36\\).

Then:\n\\[ A + B = 36 \\]\n\\[ A - B = 11k \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nFrom the equations:\n\\[ A + B = 36 \\]\n\\[ A - B = 11k \\]\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[ 2A = 36 + 11k \\]\n\\[ A = 18 + \\frac{11k}{2} \\]\n\nSubtracting these equations:\n\\[ 2B = 36 - 11k \\]\n\\[ B = 18 - \\frac{11k}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to be integers, \\(\\frac{11k}{2}\\) must be an integer, implying \\(k\\) must be even. Let \\(k = 2m\\):\n\\[ A = 18 + 11m \\]\n\\[ B = 18 - 11m \\]\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be sums of four digits from \\(1\\) to \\(8\\), they must satisfy:\n\\[ 10 \\leq A \\leq 26 \\]\n\\[ 10 \\leq B \\leq 26 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding Valid \\(m\\)\nWe solve for \\(m\\):\n\\[ 10 \\leq 18 + 11m \\leq 26 \\]\n\\[ -8 \\leq 11m \\leq 8 \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{8}{11} \\leq m \\leq \\frac{8}{11} \\]\nThus, \\(m = 0\\) or \\(m = \\pm 1\\).\n\n- For \\(m = 0\\):\n  \\[ A = 18, B = 18 \\]\n- For \\(m = 1\\):\n  \\[ A = 29 \\] (not possible)\n- For \\(m = -1\\):\n  \\[ A = 7, B = 25 \\] (not possible)\n\nSo, only \\(m = 0\\) is valid, giving:\n\\[ A = 18, B = 18 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Counting Permutations\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose 4 digits out of 8 such that their sum is 18. The valid combinations are:\n\\[ (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 3, 6, 8), (1, 4, 5, 8), (1, 4, 6, 7), (2, 3, 5, 8), (2, 3, 6, 7), (2, 4, 5, 7) \\]\n\nEach combination has \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\) way to arrange them in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and the remaining 4 digits can be arranged in \\(4!\\) ways. Thus, there are \\(7 \\times 4! = 168\\) valid permutations for each even last digit.\n\n### Step 7: Total Count\nSince there are 4 choices for the last digit:\n\\[ N = 4 \\times 168 = 672 \\]\n\n### Step 8: Final Calculation\nThe difference between \\(N\\) and \\(2025\\):\n\\[ 2025 - 672 = 1353 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1353}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve the given system of equations involving the complex number \\( z \\), we start by interpreting each equation geometrically.\n\nThe first equation is:\n\\[ |25 + 20i - z| = 5. \\]\nThis represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \\( 25 + 20i \\) with radius 5.\n\nThe second equation is:\n\\[ |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|. \\]\nThis represents the set of points equidistant from \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\). Geometrically, this is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\).\n\nFor the system to have exactly one complex solution, the circle and the perpendicular bisector must intersect at exactly one point. This means the perpendicular bisector must pass through the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\).\n\nFirst, we find the midpoint of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\):\n\\[ \\text{Midpoint} = \\left( \\frac{4 + 0}{2}, \\frac{k + k}{2} \\right) = \\left( 2, k \\right). \\]\n\nThe slope of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Slope} = \\frac{k - k}{4 - 0} = 0. \\]\nThus, the perpendicular bisector is a vertical line passing through \\( (2, k) \\).\n\nFor the circle to intersect this line at exactly one point, the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\) must lie on this vertical line. Therefore, the real part of the center must equal the x-coordinate of the midpoint:\n\\[ 25 = 2. \\]\nThis is not possible, so we need to consider the y-coordinate instead. The imaginary part of the center must equal the y-coordinate of the midpoint:\n\\[ 20 = k. \\]\n\nThus, the only value of \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( k = 20 \\).\n\nSince there is only one possible value for \\( k \\), the sum of all possible values of \\( k \\) is simply \\( 20 \\). In the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime, we have \\( m = 20 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( m + n = 20 + 1 = 21 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the piecewise linear function \\( f(x) \\) and the parabola \\( x = 34y^2 \\). Given the periodicity \\( f(x+4) = f(x) \\), we only need to consider the intervals \\([-1, 1]\\) and \\([1, 3]\\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} \nx & \\text{if } -1 \\leq x < 1 \\\\\n2 - x & \\text{if } 1 \\leq x < 3 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Set up the equations for intersection\nWe need to solve \\( x = 34y^2 \\) with each piece of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n#### Interval \\([-1, 1)\\):\nHere, \\( f(x) = x \\). So, we solve:\n\\[\nx = 34y^2 \\implies 34y^2 = x\n\\]\nSince \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\), we have:\n\\[\n-1 \\leq 34y^2 < 1\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}} \\leq y < \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\n\\]\nThus, the corresponding \\( y \\)-values are:\n\\[\ny = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\n\\]\n\n#### Interval \\([1, 3)\\):\nHere, \\( f(x) = 2 - x \\). So, we solve:\n\\[\nx = 34y^2 \\implies 34y^2 = 2 - x\n\\]\nSince \\( 1 \\leq x < 3 \\), we have:\n\\[\n1 \\leq 2 - 34y^2 < 3\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n-1 < 34y^2 \\leq 1\n\\]\nThus, the corresponding \\( y \\)-values are:\n\\[\ny = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum the \\( y \\)-coordinates\nFrom both intervals, the \\( y \\)-coordinates are:\n\\[\ny = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\n\\]\nThe sum of these \\( y \\)-coordinates is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Consider the periodicity\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with period 4, we need to check the intervals \\([3, 7)\\), \\([7, 11)\\), etc., but the pattern repeats every 4 units. Each interval will contribute the same \\( y \\)-values.\n\n### Step 5: Final sum\nGiven the symmetry and periodicity, the total sum of \\( y \\)-coordinates over all intervals is still zero.\n\nThus, the sum of the \\( y \\)-coordinates of all intersection points is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",

Find $a+b.$\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequalities \\(x - yz < y - zx < z - xy\\) under the constraint \\(x + y + z = 75\\).\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequalities:\n1. \\(x - yz < y - zx\\)\n2. \\(y - zx < z - xy\\)\n\nFrom the first inequality, we get:\n\\[x - yz < y - zx \\implies x + zx < y + yz \\implies x(1 + z) < y(1 + z)\\]\nIf \\(z \\neq -1\\), we can divide both sides by \\(1 + z\\) to get:\n\\[x < y\\]\n\nFrom the second inequality, we get:\n\\[y - zx < z - xy \\implies y + xy < z + zx \\implies y(1 + x) < z(1 + x)\\]\nIf \\(x \\neq -1\\), we can divide both sides by \\(1 + x\\) to get:\n\\[y < z\\]\n\nCombining these results, we have:\n\\[x < y < z \\quad \\text{if} \\quad z \\neq -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\neq -1\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the case when \\(z = -1\\) or \\(x = -1\\). If \\(z = -1\\), then the second inequality becomes:\n\\[y + xy < -1 - xy \\implies y(1 + x) < -1 - xy \\implies y(1 + x) < -1 - xy \\implies y(1 + x) < -1 - xy \\implies y(1 + x) < -1 - xy\\]\nThis is not possible since the left side is non-negative and the right side is negative. Therefore, \\(z \\neq -1\\).\n\nSimilarly, if \\(x = -1\\), then the first inequality becomes:\n\\[-1 - yz < y + yz \\implies -1 < y + 2yz \\implies -1 < y(1 + 2z)\\]\nThis is not possible since the left side is negative and the right side is non-negative. Therefore, \\(x \\neq -1\\).\n\nSo, we have \\(x < y < z\\). Now, we need to find the region defined by these inequalities on the plane \\(x + y + z = 75\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(z = 75 - x - y\\) into the inequalities, we get:\n\\[x < y < 75 - x - y\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[2x < 75 - y \\implies y > 2x\\]\n\\[2y < 75 - x \\implies y < \\frac{75 - x}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the region is bounded by:\n\\[2x < y < \\frac{75 - x}{2}\\]\n\\[x + y + z = 75 \\implies z = 75 - x - y\\]\n\nTo find the area of the finite region, we need to project this region onto the \\(xy\\)-plane. The boundaries are:\n\\[y = 2x\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{75 - x}{2}\\]\n\nSetting these equal to find the intersection:\n\\[2x = \\frac{75 - x}{2} \\implies 4x = 75 - x \\implies 5x = 75 \\implies x = 15\\]\n\\[y = 2(15) = 30\\]\n\nSo, the vertices of the triangle in the \\(xy\\)-plane are \\((15, 30)\\), \\((0, 0)\\), and \\((0, 75/2)\\). The base of the triangle is along the line \\(x = 0\\) from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 37.5\\), and the height is along the line \\(y = 0\\) from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 15\\).\n\nThe area of the triangle is:\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times 30 = 225\\]\n\nHowever, we need to express this in the form \\(a\\sqrt{b}\\). Since the area is a perfect square, we have:\n\\[225 = 45\\sqrt{5}\\]\nThus, \\(a = 45\\) and \\(b = 5\\), so \\(a + b = 50\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{50}\\]",

He draws $25$ more lines segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting these two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these $27$ line segments divide the disk.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.",
    "response": "To determine the expected number of regions into which the disk is divided by 27 line segments, we need to analyze how the addition of each new line segment affects the number of regions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basic scenario:\n- A single line segment divides the disk into 2 regions.\n- Each additional line segment can intersect all previous line segments, creating new regions.\n\nThe formula for the maximum number of regions created by \\( n \\) lines in a plane is given by:\n\\[\nR(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\n\\]\n\nHowever, in our problem, the lines are restricted to lie entirely within the disk and not extend beyond its boundary. This means we need to consider the intersections and regions formed within the disk.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The disk is initially divided into 4 quadrants by two perpendicular diameters.\n   - We start with no lines, so there are 4 regions.\n\n2. **Adding Lines:**\n   - Each new line segment can intersect all previous line segments, creating new regions.\n   - The key is to count the number of intersection points and how they affect the region count.\n\n3. **Expected Number of Intersections:**\n   - For each new line segment, the expected number of intersection points with existing line segments can be calculated.\n   - Since each line segment is chosen randomly, the expected number of intersections for a new line segment is proportional to the number of existing line segments.\n\n4. **Region Count Calculation:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the total number of line segments (initially 0).\n   - When adding the \\( k \\)-th line segment, it intersects with \\( L \\) previous line segments, creating \\( L \\) new regions plus the initial 4 regions.\n   - The expected number of regions after adding \\( k \\) line segments is:\n     \\[\n     R(k) = 4 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = 4 + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - We need to find \\( R(27) \\):\n     \\[\n     R(27) = 4 + \\sum_{i=1}^{27} i = 4 + \\frac{27 \\cdot 28}{2} = 4 + 378 = 382\n     \\]\n\nThus, the expected number of regions into which the 27 line segments divide the disk is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{382}\n\\]",

We will use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \\(a^3 \\equiv a \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nFirst, note that \\(a^3 \\equiv a \\pmod{3}\\) for any integer \\(a\\).

    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two chosen chairs are adjacent. We will use combinatorial methods to find this number.\n\nFirst, let's denote the chosen chairs by 'X' and the unchosen chairs by 'O'. Since no two 'X's can be adjacent, we can think of placing 'X's with at least one 'O' between each pair of 'X's. This means if we have 8 'X's, there must be at least 7 'O's between them, leaving us with \\(16 - 8 - 7 = 1\\) additional 'O' to place freely among the gaps created by the 'X's and 'O's.\n\nWe can visualize the arrangement as follows: _X_O_X_O_X_O_X_O_X_O_X_O_X_O_X_O_X_. Here, the underscores represent the possible positions for the remaining 'O'. There are 9 gaps (including the ends) where we can place the last 'O'. So, we need to choose 1 gap out of these 9 to place the last 'O'. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{9}{1} = 9\\).\n\nHowever, this is not the complete solution because we need to consider all possible ways to arrange 8 'X's and the remaining 'O's. The correct approach is to use a transformation. If we remove one 'O' from the sequence to ensure no two 'X's are adjacent, we are left with a sequence of 15 positions (16 - 1) where we need to choose 8 positions for 'X's. This is equivalent to choosing 8 positions out of 9 (since the removed 'O' creates an extra gap), which is \\(\\binom{9}{8} = 9\\).\n\nBut we need to generalize this for any number of 'O's. If we have \\(k\\) 'O's, then we need to choose 8 positions out of \\(k+1\\) (since \\(k\\) 'O's create \\(k+1\\) gaps). The total number of 'O's we can have is from 1 to 8 (since we need at least 7 'O's plus 1 more).

This means we are essentially looking for perfect matchings in the graph formed by the vertices of the 24-gon.\n\nFirst, observe that a regular 24-gon can be inscribed in a circle, and the vertices can be labeled as \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 23\\) in a clockwise manner. The segments must be of equal length, which implies that each segment connects two vertices that are separated by the same number of steps around the circle. Since there are 24 vertices, the possible segment lengths are 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 (each length \\(k\\) corresponds to a segment connecting vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+k\\) or \\(i-k\\)).\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the segments must be of equal length, and the only way to do this while ensuring each vertex is used exactly once is to use segments of length 2. This is because if we use any other length, we would either have an odd number of vertices left unmatched or we would not be able to form a perfect matching.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of perfect matchings in a cycle graph with 24 vertices where each edge has length 2. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to pair up the vertices such that each pair is separated by exactly 2 steps.\n\nWe can visualize this as arranging 12 pairs of vertices. The first vertex can be paired with any of the next 11 vertices that are 2 steps away. After the first pair is chosen, the next available vertex to pair with any of the remaining 10 vertices that are 2 steps away, and so on. However, since the graph is cyclic, we need to divide by 12 to account for the rotational symmetry.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times \\cdots \\times 3}{12!}\n\\]\nThis product can be simplified using factorials:\n\\[\n\\frac{23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times \\cdots \\times 3}{12!} = \\frac{23!!}{12!} = \\frac{23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1}{12!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n\\[\n23!! = 23 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 24572054438400\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n12! = 479001600\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\frac{24572054438400}{479001600} = 510510\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal length so that each vertex in \\(S\\) is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments is \\(\\boxed{270270}\\).",
