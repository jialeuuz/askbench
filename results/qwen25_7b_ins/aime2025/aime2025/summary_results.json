The even digits among \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are \\(2, 4, 6, 8\\).

For an eight-digit number \\(d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6d_7d_8\\), the alternating sum is:\n\\[ d_1 - d_2 + d_3 - d_4 + d_5 - d_6 + d_7 - d_8 \\]\nThis sum must be a multiple of \\(11\\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting Valid Permutations\nWe need to count the permutations of the digits \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) such that the alternating sum is a multiple of \\(11\\). This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached using generating functions or symmetry arguments, but here we will use a more straightforward method by considering the properties of the digits.\n\n#### Sum of Digits\nThe sum of the digits \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36\\). If we let \\(S\\) be the sum of the first four digits, then the sum of the last four digits is \\(36 - S\\). The alternating sum is:\n\\[ S - (36 - S) = 2S - 36 \\]\nFor this to be a multiple of \\(11\\), \\(2S - 36 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}\\), which simplifies to:\n\\[ 2S \\equiv 36 \\pmod{11} \\]\n\\[ 2S \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of \\(2\\) modulo \\(11\\), which is \\(6\\) (since \\(2 \\times 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\)), we get:\n\\[ S \\equiv 3 \\times 6 \\pmod{11} \\]\n\\[ S \\equiv 18 \\pmod{11} \\]\n\\[ S \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Counting Valid \\(S\\)\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose four digits from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}\\) such that their sum is \\(7 \\pmod{11}\\). We can list all combinations and check their sums:\n\n- \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7\\)\n- \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 0\\) (not possible since 0 is not in the set)\n- \\(1 + 3 + 4 - 1\\) (not possible since -1 is not in the set)\n- \\(2 + 3 + 4 - 1\\) (not possible since -1 is not in the set)\n\nAfter checking all combinations, we find that the valid sets are:\n- \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 1\\}\\) (not valid since 1 is repeated)\n- \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 1\\}\\) (not valid since 1 is repeated)\n\nThus, there are no valid sets of four digits whose sum is \\(7 \\pmod{11}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nSince there are no valid sets of four digits that satisfy the condition, there are no eight-digit numbers formed by the digits \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) that are divisible by \\(22\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(N = 0\\).\n\nFinally, the difference between \\(N\\) and \\(2025\\) is:\n\\[ 2025 - N = 2025 - 0 = 2025 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2025}\n\\]",

        "response": "To solve for \\( r^2 + s^2 \\) where \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) are the lengths of the parallel sides of an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle, we start by using the given information: the radius of the inscribed circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72.\n\n### Step 1: Use the Area Formula for Trapezoids with an Inscribed Circle\nFor a trapezoid with an inscribed circle, the area can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = r \\times h\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the inscribed circle and \\( h \\) is the height of the trapezoid. Given that the radius \\( r = 3 \\) and the area is 72, we can write:\n\\[\n72 = 3 \\times h\n\\]\nSolving for \\( h \\):\n\\[\nh = \\frac{72}{3} = 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Height to the Parallel Sides\nThe height \\( h \\) of the trapezoid is also the distance between the two parallel sides \\( r \\) and \\( s \\). In an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle, the height can be related to the legs and the parallel sides. Specifically, the height \\( h \\) is the same as the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius:\n\\[\nh = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with our earlier calculation. Revisiting the problem, we realize that the correct height should be used in the area formula directly, not as a separate step for verification.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Property of Tangents from a Point\nIn an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle, the sum of the lengths of the opposite tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency on the non-parallel sides is equal. This gives us:\n\\[\na + c = b + d\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the segments of one leg, and \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) are the lengths of the segments of the other leg. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, \\( a = d \\) and \\( b = c \\).\n\n### Step 4: Use the Area and Height to Find the Sum of the Parallel Sides\nThe area of the trapezoid can also be expressed using the sum of the parallel sides:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (r + s) \\times h\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n72 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (r + s) \\times 24\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n72 = 12 \\times (r + s)\n\\]\nSolving for \\( r + s \\):\n\\[\nr + s = \\frac{72}{12} = 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to Find \\( r^2 + s^2 \\)\nWe need to find \\( r^2 + s^2 \\). We know:\n\\[\n(r + s)^2 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( r + s = 6 \\):\n\\[\n6^2 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = r^2 + s^2 + 2rs\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Find \\( rs \\)\nUsing the area formula again:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (r + s) \\times h\n\\]\n\\[\n72 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times h\n\\]\n\\[\n72 = 3h\n\\]\n\\[\nh = 24\n\\]\nSince the height is 24, we use the right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base.

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Pair the Letters\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to pair the 12 letters \\( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 12 for the first pair is:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{2}\n\\]\n\nAfter choosing the first pair, we have 10 letters left. The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of these 10 for the second pair is:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{2}\n\\]\n\nContinuing this process, the number of ways to choose the remaining pairs is:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2}, \\binom{6}{2}, \\binom{4}{2}, \\binom{2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of ways to pair all 12 letters is the product of these binomial coefficients:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{8}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{2}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to pair the letters is:\n\\[\n66 \\times 45 \\times 28 \\times 15 \\times 6 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Favorable Outcomes\nNext, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the last word in the list contains \\( G \\).\n\nFor \\( G \\) to be in the last word, it must be paired with one of the remaining 11 letters. Let’s consider the possible pairs involving \\( G \\):\n- \\( GA \\)\n- \\( GB \\)\n- \\( GC \\)\n- \\( GD \\)\n- \\( GE \\)\n- \\( GF \\)\n- \\( GG \\) (not possible since \\( G \\) cannot be paired with itself)\n- \\( GH \\)\n- \\( GI \\)\n- \\( GJ \\)\n- \\( GK \\)\n- \\( GL \\)\n\nThere are 11 possible pairs involving \\( G \\).\n\n### Step 3: Arranging the Remaining Letters\nAfter forming a pair involving \\( G \\), we have 10 letters left to pair.

We will consider the coloring of the shared edges between adjacent squares.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Coloring the Top Edge:**\n   - The top edge can be split into two segments: one between Square 1 and Square 2, and another between Square 3 and Square 4.\n   - There are 2 ways to color these two segments: either both are red, or one is red and the other is blue.\n\n2. **Coloring the Bottom Edge:**\n   - Similarly, the bottom edge can be split into two segments: one between Square 1 and Square 3, and another between Square 2 and Square 4.\n   - There are also 2 ways to color these two segments.\n\n3. **Coloring the Left Edge:**\n   - The left edge can be split into two segments: one between Square 1 and Square 3, and another between Square 2 and Square 4.\n   - There are 2 ways to color these two segments.\n\n4. **Coloring the Right Edge:**\n   - The right edge can be split into two segments: one between Square 1 and Square 2, and another between Square 3 and Square 4.\n   - There are 2 ways to color these two segments.\n\n5. **Ensuring Each Square Has Exactly Two Red and Two Blue Sides:**\n   - We need to ensure that the coloring of the shared edges satisfies the condition for each square.\n   - For each square, if it shares a red side with one neighbor, it must share a blue side with the other neighbor to maintain the balance.\n\n### Counting Valid Colorings:\n\nWe will now count the valid configurations by considering the constraints:\n\n- **Top Edge:** 2 choices (both red or one red and one blue).\n- **Bottom Edge:** 2 choices (both red or one red and one blue).\n- **Left Edge:** 2 choices (both red or one red and one blue).\n- **Right Edge:** 2 choices (both red or one red and one blue).\n\nHowever, not all combinations of these choices will satisfy the condition for each square. We need to check the compatibility of these choices.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(a\\): top edge is both red.\n- \\(b\\): top edge is one red and one blue.\n- \\(c\\): bottom edge is both red.\n- \\(d\\): bottom edge is one red and one blue.\n- \\(e\\): left edge is both red.\n- \\(f\\): left edge is one red and one blue.\n- \\(g\\): right edge is both red.\n- \\(h\\): right edge is one red and one blue.\n\nWe need to ensure:\n- If \\(a\\), then the bottom edge must be \\(d\\).\n- If \\(b\\), then the bottom edge can be \\(c\\) or \\(d\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the left and right edges.\n\nBy analyzing the constraints, we find that there are 8 valid configurations:\n1. Both top and bottom edges are both red.\n2. Both top and bottom edges are one red and one blue.\n3. Both left and right edges are both red.\n4. Both left and right edges are one red and one blue.\n5. Mixed configurations where the top and bottom edges are different from the left and right edges.\n\nThus, the total number of valid colorings is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

We will analyze the conditions under which the greedy algorithm fails to give the minimum number of coins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Greedy Algorithm**: The greedy algorithm always chooses the largest coin first, i.e., 25 cents, then 10 cents, and finally 1 cent.\n2. **Example Analysis**:\n   - To make 42 cents: Greedy algorithm: 25 + 10 + 7 * 1 = 32 coins.\n   - Optimal solution: 4 * 10 + 2 * 1 = 42 cents using 6 coins.\n   \n3. **Identifying Failures**:\n   - The greedy algorithm will fail if there exists another combination of coins that uses fewer coins to achieve the same value.\n   - Specifically, the failure occurs when using 25 cents and 10 cents in such a way that it results in more coins than using just 10 cents and 1 cent.\n\n4. **Key Insight**:\n   - If the number of 10-cent coins is 2 or less, the greedy algorithm will always be optimal.\n   - If the number of 10-cent coins is 3 or more, we can potentially use more 1-cent coins instead, reducing the total number of coins.\n\n5. **Formulating the Condition**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of 25-cent coins, \\( y \\) be the number of 10-cent coins, and \\( z \\) be the number of 1-cent coins.\n   - The value \\( N \\) is given by \\( 25x + 10y + z \\).\n   - The greedy algorithm will fail if we can replace some 25-cent and 10-cent coins with 1-cent coins to get a smaller total number of coins.\n\n6. **Checking for Failures**:\n   - If \\( y \\geq 3 \\), we can replace one 25-cent coin and two 10-cent coins with three 10-cent coins and 50 1-cent coins, resulting in fewer coins.\n   - Therefore, the greedy algorithm fails if \\( y \\geq 3 \\).\n\n7. **Counting Valid \\( N \\)**:\n   - We need to count the values of \\( N \\) from 1 to 1000 for which \\( y < 3 \\).\n   - For each valid \\( y \\) (0, 1, 2), we need to count the possible combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n8. **Calculation**:\n   - For \\( y = 0 \\): \\( 25x + z \\leq 1000 \\). Number of solutions: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{25} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 41 \\).\n   - For \\( y = 1 \\): \\( 25x + 10 + z \\leq 1000 \\Rightarrow 25x + z \\leq 990 \\). Number of solutions: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{990}{25} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 40 \\).\n   - For \\( y = 2 \\): \\( 25x + 20 + z \\leq 1000 \\Rightarrow 25x + z \\leq 980 \\).

If no two selected chairs are adjacent, we can think of placing the unselected chairs first and then determining where the selected chairs can go.\n\nIf we have 8 unselected chairs, they create 9 possible slots (gaps) for the selected chairs: one before the first unselected chair, one between each pair of unselected chairs, and one after the last unselected chair.

We need to choose 8 out of these 9 slots to place the selected chairs.
