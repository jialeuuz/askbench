We will use combinatorial methods to find the number of valid subsets and then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, let's define \\( N \\) as the number of ways to choose 8 non-adjacent chairs from 16. To simplify, we can transform the problem into one where the chairs are not adjacent. If we select 8 chairs such that no two are adjacent, we can think of placing \"gaps\" between them. If we place 8 chairs, there must be at least one empty chair between each pair of selected chairs. This means we need to place 7 gaps (one between each pair of selected chairs) plus the remaining chairs.\n\nLet's denote the number of empty chairs as \\( k \\). Since we have 16 chairs total and we need to place 8 selected chairs with at least one gap between them, we have:\n\\[ k + 8 - 7 = 16 \\implies k = 9 \\]\nSo, we need to distribute 9 empty chairs among 9 gaps (including the ends). This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_9 = 9 \\]\nwhere \\( x_i \\geq 0 \\).

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can draw 12 segments of equal length on a regular 24-gon such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one segment. This means we are essentially partitioning the 24 vertices into 12 pairs.\n\nThe key insight here is recognizing that drawing segments of equal length implies that each segment spans the same number of vertices. Since \\(24\\) is even, the only possible way to have equal length segments is if each segment spans \\(2k\\) vertices where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only feasible \\(k\\) for our purpose is \\(k = 12/2 = 6\\), meaning each segment spans 12 vertices (halfway around the polygon).\n\nGiven this setup, we need to find how many ways we can pair up the vertices.
